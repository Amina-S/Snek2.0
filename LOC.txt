LOC per person: 

The reason we have relatively few lines of code is becuase the main challenge 
of the project turned out not to be the framework of the game (snake, state 
modules, etc.) but finetuning the engine. We spent a huge portion of our 
time just trying to get the user input to work, and you can see that it's still
not perfect, but this is the best way we could implement it with  Ocaml. It 
was especially difficult to make a timed request, that would only wait for user 
input for a certain amount of time and then do something else if time expires 
(waiting for user to change the snake's direction or continuing moving after 
1 second). This involved using nuanced features like [Unix.alarm] and signals 
in Unix. We believe the effort it took to work around the unexpected nuances
of making a decent interface and gameflow makes up for the slight deficioncy 
of LOC.
